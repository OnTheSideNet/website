# On The Side 

Close-knit community of creatives who support each other's side projects in Slack.

[**Join the conversation** - it's *free*!](https://join.slack.com/t/onthesideworkspace/shared_invite/enQtNzA0MTcyOTk4MzA2LWEzNjcxODIzM2I3ZjA0MWQ2YTI4YzcxZGMxNTkwNGI5ZGRkYWZmYWVmOTdmOTc3NmIyZjRmN2RmMjk1NTZlZGQ)

## Who?

Founded by [Si](https://sijobling.com/) and [Ben](https://twitter.com/brussels) in July 2019, the community has grown with over 100 members now participating.

There's naturally some who are more active than others but we're all a friendly bunch, prepared to help and encourage each other to share progress on side projects, along with a healthy balance of fun and laughter along the way.

## What we're working on?

This is not an exhaustive list of all the projects we've worked on, more an indicator of work in progress (WIP). Each member is encouraged to update this themselves through a pull-request. (Again, some might be more active than others)
