# On The Side 

Close-knit community of creatives who support each other's side projects in Slack.

[**Join the conversation** - it's *free*!](https://join.slack.com/t/onthesideworkspace/shared_invite/enQtNzA0MTcyOTk4MzA2LWEzNjcxODIzM2I3ZjA0MWQ2YTI4YzcxZGMxNTkwNGI5ZGRkYWZmYWVmOTdmOTc3NmIyZjRmN2RmMjk1NTZlZGQ)

## Why?

### Encouragement  

Many people struggle to have the motivation on side projects - we're here to help you get over the first hump and support you along the way.

### Bounce ideas

Whether it's a simple concept that needs thrashing out or a problem that you need help with, there are plenty of people from different disciplines to give you useful ideas.

### Demonstrate

Share your work with fellow creatives to show off what you've made and feel the satisfaction of "_I made that_"!

###Â Feedback

Whether it's positive or constructive, we all benefit from feedback. By sharing your work with fellow side project creatives, it's a safer place to know what works and needs improvement.

### Accountability

With regular check-ins, be them `#week-goals` or daily `#standup`, you're holding yourself accountable on your commitments to help drive delivery.

### Learn

By sharing our own stories and progress, you can learn so much from what others are doing. It could be problem solving, technical or a whole new industry to you.

## Who?

Founded by [Si](https://sijobling.com/) and [Ben](https://twitter.com/brussels) in July 2019, the community has grown with **over 100 members** now participating.

There's naturally some who are more active regular members than others but we're all a friendly bunch, prepared to help and encourage each other to share progress on [side projects](Projects), along with a healthy balance of fun and laughter along the way.
