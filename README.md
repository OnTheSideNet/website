# On The Side 

A Slack community for sharing progress on your side projects to encourage support and motivation.

[**Join in** - it's *free*!](https://join.slack.com/t/onthesideworkspace/shared_invite/enQtNzA0MTcyOTk4MzA2LWEzNjcxODIzM2I3ZjA0MWQ2YTI4YzcxZGMxNTkwNGI5ZGRkYWZmYWVmOTdmOTc3NmIyZjRmN2RmMjk1NTZlZGQ)

## Who?

Founded by [Si](https://sijobling.com/) and [Ben](https://twitter.com/brussels), the community has grown since Summer 2019 with nearly 30 members now contributing.

There's naturally some who are more active than others but we're all a friendly bunch, prepared to help and encourage each other to share progress on side projects, along with a healthy balance of fun and laughter along the way.

## What we're working on?

This is not an exhaustive list of all the projects we've worked on, more an indicator of work in progress (WIP). Each member is encouraged to update this themselves through a pull-request. (Again, some might be more active than others)
