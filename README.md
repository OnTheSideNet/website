## Why?

### Encouragement üôå

Many people struggle to have the motivation on side projects - we're here to help you get over the first hump and support you along the way.

### Bounce Ideas üí≠

Whether it's a simple concept that needs thrashing out or a problem that you need help with, there are plenty of people from different disciplines to give you useful ideas.

### Demonstrate üìΩ

Share your work with fellow creatives to show off what you've made and feel the satisfaction of "_I made that_"!

###¬†Feedback Loop üîÑ

Whether it's positive or constructive, we all benefit from feedback. By sharing your work with fellow side project creatives, it's a safer place to know what works and needs improvement.

### Accountability üëå

With regular check-ins, be them `#week-goals` or daily `#standup`, you're holding yourself accountable on your commitments to help drive delivery.

### Learn üßë‚Äçüè´

By sharing our own stories and progress, you can learn so much from what others are doing. It could be problem solving, technical or a whole new industry to you.
