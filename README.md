## Who?

Founded by [Si](https://sijobling.com/) and [Ben](https://twitter.com/brussels) in July 2019, the community has grown with **over 100 members** now participating.

There's naturally some who are more active than others but we're all a friendly bunch, prepared to help and encourage each other to share progress on [side projects](Projects), along with a healthy balance of fun and laughter along the way.
